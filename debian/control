Package: protobuf-compiler
Architecture: amd64
Description: compiler for protocol buffer definition files
 This package contains the protocol buffer compiler that is used for
 translating from .proto files (containing the definitions) to the language
 binding for the supported languages.
Depends: 
 ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends},
 libprotoc32t64 (= ${source:Version}),

Package: python3-protobuf
Architecture: amd64
Section: python
Description: Python 3 bindings for protocol buffers
 This package contains the Python 3 bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.
