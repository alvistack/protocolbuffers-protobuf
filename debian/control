Section: libs
Description: protocol buffers C++ library (lite version)
 This package contains the runtime library needed for C++ applications whose
 message definitions have the "lite runtime" optimization setting.
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
 ${shlibs:Depends},

Package: libprotobuf-dev
Architecture: amd64
Section: libdevel
Description: protocol buffers C++ library (development files) and proto files
 This package contains the development headers and static libraries needed for
 writing C++ applications. Includes well known proto type files.
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},
 zlib1g-dev,
 libprotobuf32 (= ${source:Version}),
 libprotobuf-lite32 (= ${source:Version}),
Breaks:

 ${misc:Depends},

Package: libprotoc-dev
Architecture: amd64
Section: libdevel
Description: protocol buffers compiler library (development files)
 This package contains the development headers and static library needed for
 writing protobuf compilers.
Depends:
 ${misc:Depends},

Package: protobuf-compiler
Architecture: amd64
Description: compiler for protocol buffer definition files
 This package contains the protocol buffer compiler that is used for
 translating from .proto files (containing the definitions) to the language
 binding for the supported languages.
Depends: 
 ${shlibs:Depends},
 ${misc:Depends},
 libprotoc32 (= ${binary:Version}),

Package: python3-protobuf
Architecture: amd64
Section: python
Description: Python 3 bindings for protocol buffers
 This package contains the Python 3 bindings for the protocol buffers. You will
 need the protoc tool (in the protobuf-compiler package) to compile your
 definition to Python classes, and then the modules in this package will allow
 you to use those classes in your programs.
